## Impact + Purpose

I'm focused on empowering everyone in the world to build and express on the internet at Webflow. I lead Product Design and User Research to understand what human needs are to build the most intuitive visual development platform. At On Deck, I'm focused on developing humans. As a Design Partner for On Deck Design, I have the pleasure facilitating community-based learning with some of the best design leaders out there.

## Experimentation

I find joy in creating and learning. Here are a few projects I'm working on:

- A newsletter called [Proof of Concept](http://davidhoang.substack.com) focused on creativity and experimentation
- Research on the history of visual programming languages
