# davidhoang.com

Welcome! In this repo I'll store the content layer of my website at [davidhoang.com](http://davidhoang.com). I define content layer not as the data source but the latest updates of images, text, and other resources. My site is built on Webflow and the data is hosted on their servers.

Have feedback or see a bug? [Submit an issue](https://github.com/davidhoang/davidhoang.com/issues)

## Building in public
I'm using this repo as a way to document updating the website. If this is interesting to you go ahead and follow the repo. A fair warning that push to GitHub _a lot_ and often do things bite-sized. Your notifications have been warned.

## Release notes
I haven't kept track of versions so will start with 1.0 as a starting point.

### 1.01
- Removed Disqus commenting system. I don't get much comments on my blog so will remove it. I've been using Disqus for years but don't like the random ads they serve on the free plan and don't want to pay for it
- Created a "Now" page to share the most recent updates
- Added a few images of myself to make it feel more like a personal website
