Welcome! In this repo I'll store the content layer of my website. I define content layer not as the data source but the latest updates of images, text, and other resources. My site is built on Webflow and the data is hosted on their servers.

Have feedback or see a bug? [Submit an issue](https://github.com/davidhoang/davidhoang.com/issues)
